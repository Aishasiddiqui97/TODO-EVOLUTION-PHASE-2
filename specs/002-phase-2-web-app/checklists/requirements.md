# Specification Quality Checklist: Phase II Full-Stack Todo Web App

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-09
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED

### Findings

All checklist items have been validated and passed:

1. **Content Quality**: Spec is focused on user value (sign in, manage todos, privacy/isolation, responsive UX) and avoids implementation details.
2. **Requirement Completeness**: No clarification markers remain. Requirements are testable, acceptance scenarios and edge cases are defined.
3. **Scope/Assumptions/Dependencies**: Out-of-scope items, assumptions, dependencies, and constraints are explicitly captured.

## Notes

- Specification is ready for `/sp.plan`.
